                    <h2>Our Concept to make dining out easy!</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to make eating out easy for everyone involved. In Germany, it is mandatory to declare the 14 main allergens on products but also in restaurants.
                    This helps people with food intolerances but the employee in restaurants need to research a lot about each of the allergens to declare it without any mistakes.
                    <br><br>
                    That's where easyMenu wants to help. The restaurants can scan all their products and create ingredients list for the dishes like that.
                    The employee in the restaurants also get tips and hints for how to cook considering all allergens.
                    easyMenu will automatically mark all allergens based on the ingredients list provided.
                    Via our app, all customers can view the restaurants menu online including declared allergens.
                    This makes it easier for all visitors of the restaurant to choose the best fitting dish and see an overview of the customized options.
                </p>

                                    Currently, we partnered with 10.000 restaurants. You can see all of them in our map overview in the app.

                                    There are several ways to check our transparency.
                                    <br><br>1. we will upload monthly our income and how we use it to an external website.
                                    <br><br>2. if you want to check the current status of the company or other features of the product, we offer you calls to our HQ. All you have to do is to send us an email.
                                    <br><br>3. if you want to know the ingredients of specific dishes, we can provide them as long as the restaurant didn't declare it as company secret.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <button class="accordion">Why should restaurants partner up with us?</button>

                                    By using our app to generate menus including allergens, you get a lot of advantages:
                                    <br><br>
                                    The most important one being, you don't need to learn about all your ingredients - the app does that for you and tells you what allergens are included.
                                    It also provides tips what to take care of in the kitchen to make sure no allergic reaction is caused for any customer.
                                    Furthermore, you can find guides how to prevent using allergens by only small changes in the recipe.
                                    <br><br>
                                    So, as long as you stick to the ingredient list, you provided, there is no risk of declaring allergens improperly - the responsibility is fully on the app.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Another huge advantage is that the app increases attention on your restaurant and therefore gets you more customers.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            easyMenu started as a small project, motivated by six students trying to help restaurants and their visitors.
                            It quickly developed into a huge success. We constantly work on extensions, to make the app even better,
                            including more features that contribute to a better user experience.
                            <br><br>
                            It makes us proud to see the effect our app has, and we are very thankful for all users of easyMenu.

                            Qontrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                            passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
                            1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                            At the age of 17, I developed food intolerances for gluten and lactose. It was very hard adjusting to this diet. However, over time I got used to it.
                            But one thing still stuck with me: I didn't enjoy going to restaurants. Often, I had to ask for specific menus with the allergen declaration on it or needed to get confirmation from the employee.
                            In many cases, I encountered that the allergen declaration was wrong because the employee simply didn't know.
                            Also, it happened that I needed to ask for adjustments of the original dish to avoid to be left with just salads.
                            Don't get me wrong, I like salad, but if that's the only option for the meal, that's anything but appealing!

                            That made this project very important to me - I want to help everyone with food intolerances or dietary preferences to enjoy dining out
