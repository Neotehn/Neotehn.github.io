                    How does affiliate marketing work?
                    <br><br>
                    In affiliate marketing, the company who wants to sell their products or increase awareness/attention for their product or service, will connect to a affiliate partner. They will advertise the company's product/service to their community. Depending on the size of the community and how trustworthy the influencer is viewed, the community will purchase the offer via the affiliate link that the influencer received from the company. For advertising the product, the affiliate partner receives a commission.

                    <br><br>
                    We changed this model slightly by interacting as a connector between company and their partners. We take 1% of the influencer's commission and use it to remedy shortcomings  in nature. However, both the influencer and company profits from this model. Because of the green image created, they can attract more customers and therefore sell more.

                    Influencer and the companies can also decide to share more of their income related to those affiliate links with us to increase the support and help the environment.

                                    90% of the donated money will go to an organization of your choice, the other 10% will be used for maintenance costs of the company. Short example based on a 100€ product. The entity that advertised it would get 10€ (average Amazon Affiliateshare), from that we get 1%, that is 10 cents. Of these 10 cents, 9 cents goes to an organization and 1 cent to our company.

                            An initial estimate of the global input of plastic waste into the oceans has calculated an amount of 4.8 to 12.7 million tons per year. This is equivalent to one truckload per minute.
                            More recent calculations, which include lakes, rivers and oceans, assume an input of 19 to 23 million tons into these ecosystems.

                            Again and again, we hear of horrifying news from the tropics that the forest has been destroyed.
                            Every year, around 300,000 square kilometers of forest are cut down or burned worldwide - a good half of them in tropical countries: first and foremost in Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia (source: Global Forest Watch, 2017).

                            A study proves it: If things continue like this, there could be no insects left in the world in as little as 100 years. And last but not least, changes in the seasons due to climate change also have a direct impact on wild bees.
                            As spring starts earlier each year, the flowering time of many plants also shifts. When the bees fly out, many of the plants have already faded.

                            One area where progress is urgently needed is African education. Less than 20 percent of African women have ever attended school.

                            What started as planting trees to reduce CO2 developed into remedying many different shortcomings in nature. It makes us proud to see the effect we have on this world and we are very thankful for all our partners - company, influencer and of course all the consumers! Without you valuing the well-being of our planet, we would not be able to do what we do.

                            Qontrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                            passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
                            1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
