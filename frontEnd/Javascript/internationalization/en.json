  "josiTextOne": "At the age of 17, I developed food intolerances for gluten and lactose. It was very hard adjusting to this diet. However, over time I got used to it.\nBut one thing still stuck with me: I didn't enjoy going to restaurants. Often, I had to ask for specific menus with the allergen declaration on it or needed to get confirmation from the employee.\nIn many cases, I encountered that the allergen declaration was wrong because the employee simply didn't know.\nAlso, it happened that I needed to ask for adjustments of the original dish to avoid to be left with just salads.\nDon't get me wrong, I like salad, but if that's the only option for the meal, that's anything but appealing!",
  "josiTextTwo": "That made this project very important to me - I want to help everyone with food intolerances or dietary preferences to enjoy dining out\nas well as every one else to simplify the process.",
